            <h4>About Dogman</h4>
            <p>Almost everyone has heard of Sasquatch. Not many people realize, though, a much more terrifying cryptid is stalking the forests of North America and beyond. Of course, I’m talking about Dogmen. The appellation Dogman describes a group of cryptozoological beings that are large and sometimes described as looking like upright canids…

                <article class="sec1">"If you’ve had a Dogman encounter, I can help you! I’ve helped a lot of eyewitnesses deal with their Dogman encounters.

                    Have you seen a creature that looked like a Werewolf? If you have, you’re not crazy and you’re not alone. What you saw wasn’t a Werewolf. It’s what’s called a Dogman.  More people than you’ll ever know have had encounters with them. Unfortunately, most of them don’t know who they can talk to about their encounters. That’s where I come in. My name is Vic Cundiff and I help eyewitnesses deal with the trauma of their Dogman encounters.
                    
                    Seeing a Creature that looks as scary as they do isn’t an easy experience to get over. Most eyewitnesses fear being labeled as crazy or being laughed at by friends and family if they share their experience with them. That’s why most Dogman eyewitnesses keep their encounters to themselves and consequently suffer in silence. I call that the prison without walls effect. I created DogmanEncounters.com and Dogman Encounters Radio to combat that problem. If you’re a Dogman eyewitness, you now have someone you can turn to for help. Me! If you’ve had a Dogman encounter of your own, I’d be glad to help you come to terms with your experience and deal with it. If you’ve had a Dogman encounter, please submit a report and I’ll contact you, so we can talk about your experience. The details of your encounter will remain between the two of us if you don’t want to share your experience on this website or on the show. Understand that I do not record phone conversations unless the eyewitness knows beforehand that our conversation will be recorded for a show. Also, so that you know, your voice can be altered and you can use an alternate name if you’d like to come on the show, but wish to remain anonymous."

    <h3 class="sechead">About Dogman Encounters Radio</h3>
    <div class="sec2"> 
   <p> On Dogman Encounters Radio, I talk with Dogman eyewitnesses about their encounters. Many eyewitnesses have benefitted, greatly, from sharing their experiences with the show’s listeners, in a public venue like that. If you’re a Dogman eyewitness, would coming on the show, as a guest help you come to terms with your encounter? Only you can answer that question. If you think it would, I’d love to have you on the show, as a guest. If you don’t think coming on the show would help you, I’d be happy to just speak with you about your experience, in private.

    Already, over 340 Dogman eyewitnesses have come on the show, to talk with me about their encounters. For every eyewitness who comes on the show, there are around 20 eyewitnesses who contact me but don’t come on the show. That should give you an idea of how many people out there are having encounters with Dogmen every year. If you’ve had a Dogman encounter, you’re not crazy and you’re not alone. I can help you.
